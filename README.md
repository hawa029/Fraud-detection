## Context

The Mobile Money payment simulation case study is based on a real company that has developed a mobile money implementation that offers cell phone users the ability to transfer money between themselves using their phone as an electronic wallet.

A new one has just arrived and there is now enough data to implement a system for predicting credit card fraud.

The task at hand is to develop an approach that detects suspicious activity that is indicative of fraud.
